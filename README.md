This is project a Point of Sale System that I am working on basically to practice the CRUD Operations in SpringBoot mvc architecture and to Interact with mySQL database. I have so far Learned How HTTP requests ae coming from the frontEnd and after these requests come to dispatcher serverlat these requests are then been dispatched to the Controllers. Each Controllers catch the matching requests using request Mapping(a type of handler mapping)Each controller with 3 basic annotations(@RestController, @CrossOrigin, @RequestMapping) catches these requests each method in the controller have unique link that is formed using POST,GET,PUT, or DELETE mapping, So according to mvc architecter we need to move data in controller to service data is passing using a DTO and the bean that was put into the container of the service class is injected to the controller class using @Autowired and using that object we pass data to service class using DTO,( have basically used a service interface to loosly couple the service and controller classes  ) there another injected bean from the Repo class is there and we cant further more bring data using DTO because repo need objects from ENtity classes to access databases so using Entity objects and repo object we interact with the databse for CRUD Operations
